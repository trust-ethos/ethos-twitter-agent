## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Do NOT create a public issue

Instead, please email us directly at: [security@ethos.network](mailto:security@ethos.network)

### Include the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### What to expect:

- **Initial Response**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 7 days
- **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Fix**: We'll work to resolve critical issues as quickly as possible
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate responsible disclosure with you

## Security Best Practices

When deploying this bot:

### API Keys & Credentials

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the minimum required permissions

### Network Security

- Deploy with HTTPS in production
- Use webhook secrets for Twitter webhook validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for unusual activity

### Code Security

- Keep dependencies updated
- Review code changes for security implications
- Use secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs

### Infrastructure

- Use secure deployment platforms
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Dependencies

This project uses Deno, which provides several security benefits:

- Secure by default (no file, network, or environment access without explicit permission)
- Built-in TypeScript support
- No package.json or node_modules vulnerabilities

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are properly secured:

- `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID`
- `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_API_KEY`
- `TWITTER_API_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `ETHOS_API_KEY`
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Twitter API Rate Limits**: The bot respects Twitter's rate limits to avoid service interruption
2. **Webhook Validation**: Currently uses a simplified validation; implement proper HMAC-SHA256 validation for production
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
4. **Error Handling**: Errors are logged but sensitive information is not exposed

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the security research community and welcome responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. We're committed to working with researchers to understand and address security issues.

Thank you for helping keep the Ethos Twitter Agent secure!
